we looked into this design.
> https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com

For the first version, we decided to have 5 parts in the website, we will build the architecthure of the website, so that visitors can navigate between different parts (without seeing any content)
1. **Main page**: a brief introduction to P.C.H + all the links to other parts + content updates for other parts + other links + global visitor map.
2. **Resources**: course list which is mainly related to the Youtube list but in a friendly and tailored way of display + videos and files (can be downloaded)
3. **Postboard**: let friends leave sticky notes anonymously which are also displayed on the global map background.
4. **Music player**: to play your personal album
5. **Personal life**: family life photos videos + biography + timeline display functions
